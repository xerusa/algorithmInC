### Algorithm In C

As a greener in programming, I do some exercise when reading the book 'Algorithm In C'
written by Robert Sedgewick.

I try my best to solve these algorithm problems in the book and test these codes
as much as I can. However, errors is unavoidable. It's grateful that some kind man
point out these errors and give me a better solution.

Thank you for reading my code.
